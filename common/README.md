Tripolite's common resources
=============================

This is the middle ground project for storing Tripolite's common resources. It is not meant to have any dependency
than typescript.

## How to compile
It is a good idea to compile this project at the beginning of the installation process of the project and before running 
the servers.

- Firstly, install the dependencies: `npm install`
- Secondly, compile the project: `npm run build`

That's it!

Nevertheless, its compilation will be done automatically with the compilation of the other projects.
